> I consider myself a pretty good *Mathematica* programmer, but I'm always looking out for ways to either improve my way of doing things in *Mathematica*, or to see if there's something nifty that I haven't encountered yet. Where do I look for examples of good practices of [*Mathematica* programming](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/18/where-can-i-find-examples-of-good-mathematica-programming-practice/28073#28073)

> My advice to learn *Mathematica* as if you were learning  a new natural language. Slowly, Patiently. Ability grows with use. Tackle lots of small problems. Practice expressing the same concept many different ways. Read lots of code. Read random pages from the voluminous documentation--there are many, many gems hidingin there. Don't try to bite off the whole thing at once.

In other words don't expect to comprehend all in one fell swoop. You should
have the intelligence to tell the difference between this way from an
efficient way.

It's still too much. The  principles behind is quite boring.

I feel like I lose interests in magic. I need to start the engine at first place, with the exciting feeling Mathematica brings to me, I have mood to appreciate its design. Just follow the abstract instruction makes me stupid.
